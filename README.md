Minecraft 1.18.1 sample of c/c++ tnt caves generator

Minecraft 1.18.1 sample of c/c++ tnt caves generator (converted from 1.12.2)

Sample of (13 x 13) region files created with c/c++ tnt cave generator:

https://github.com/HakkaTjakka/CAVES (Check for installers/info/mods for better play, like fixing 'player moves to quickly' msg's/teleporting back from server)

(Code is changed to get nicer (i think..) colors)
I will upload some newer region files (in 1.12.2, use minecraft->select world->edit to upgrade/convert to your current version for faster loading)

Into dir new_region.1.12.2
